              Thank you for visiting my portfolio website. When I was 16 years old
              (2005) I builded my first website in notepad with HTML for an
              acquaintance who was running a massagestudio. I builded way more
              websites after that for friends and family, first with HTML, later
              with Wordpress. But I did not start to make a career out of that. I
              started my career as a biomedical lab technician. Early on in my
              career I found out that I could do my work more efficiently by using
              programming for analysis. It started with recording simple macros in
              excel, then I started editing these macros with Visual Basic for more
              functionality. When the datasets started to become bigger I started
              using R and when I wanted my colleagues to use my programs who did not
              have programming experience I started to combine R with Java User
              Interfaces.
            </p>
            <p>
              At some point I realized that the biomedical industry was not going to
              make me happy and I decided that I wanted to build a career in web
              development. So I started a career path course towards full
              stack-developer. Understanding the fullstack really makes me
              enthusiastic, because I have always been very curious how all IT
              systems work together and as a lab technician I was also trying to
              connect different systems to improve my efficiency.
            </p>

              About my private life. I live together with my partner and daughter in
              a quiet village close to the dunes and beach in the Netherlands. We
              love good food and to be outside in nature together and doing sports like: climbing,
              ski√Øng, cycling, hiking, kayaking and swimming.
            </p>
            <p>
                I can be serious and hard working, but I also like to joke around from time to time.
